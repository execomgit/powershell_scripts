# My batch files, PowerShell scripts, etc.

https://github.com/glombard/Scripts

These are scripts I use to repave my clean Windows installation.

I use the `Repave-Win8\Install-Tools-Chocolatey.cmd` batch file to install my favourite tools on a clean Windows 8 installation. This uses [NuGet Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org) to install a few utilities from my [MyGet feed](http://www.myget.org/feed/Index/win8repavechocolatey).

`Repave-Win8\Install-Tools-Custom.cmd` performs a few settings changes and installs a few more tools with custom PowerShell scripts.
